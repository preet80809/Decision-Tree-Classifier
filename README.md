# **Decision Tree Classifier Project**

* **In this project, I developed a decision tree model using Python to classify and predict outcomes based on a given dataset. 
The project involved several key steps, each leveraging different Python libraries to ensure accuracy and efficiency.** *
1. *Data Collection and Preprocessing* -- Libraries Used: "pandas", "numpy"
   ---
   ---

 - Loaded the dataset using "pandas".

 - Handled missing values and cleaned the data.
   

 2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* -- Libraries Used: "matplotlib", "seaborn"
    ---
    ---

 - Visualized the data to understand the distribution and relationships between features.

 - Generated plots to identify trends and patterns.

 3. *Model Building* -- Libraries Used: "scikit-learn"
    ---
    ---
 - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

 - Built decision tree classifiers using DecisionTreeClassifier with different criteria: 'gini' and 'entropy'.

 - Tuned hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.

4. *Hyperparameter Tuning* -- Libraries Used: "scikit-learn"
   ---
   ---
 - Compared the performance of decision trees using gini and entropy criteria.

 - Evaluated the impact of tree depth, minimum samples split, and other hyperparameters on model accuracy and overfitting.

5. *Model Evaluation*  -- Libraries Used: "scikit-learn"
   ---
   ---
- Evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy.

- Plotted confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the classifiers.

- Performed cross-validation to ensure model robustness.

6. *Conclusion and Insights*
   ---
   ---
- Summarized the findings and insights gained from comparing the gini and entropy criteria.
- Discussed the implications of the model's predictions and potential applications.
- Highlighted the importance of hyperparameter tuning in improving model performance.
